# TypeScript Performance Optimization

Today learned that using `const enum` can improve bundle size by inlining values at compile time instead of generating JavaScript objects.

{/* truncate */}

## Key Takeaway
- Regular enums generate objects → runtime overhead
- `const enum` inlines values → zero runtime cost
- Trade-off: Can't use computed/dynamic access

## Example
```typescript
const enum Direction {
  Up,
  Down
}
// Compiles to: console.log(0)
console.log(Direction.Up);
```
