## Day 0: Just moved from cursor to claude code

*It's 11 PM on a Tuesday. My token budget just hit zero. Claude Code is asking me the same question for the fourth time: "What coding style does this project use?" I've spent 6 hours being a glorified copy-paste machine, explaining the same context over and over.*

*Sound familiar?*

That night, I realized something critical: **Claude Code is teachable**. But I was the worst teacher on Earth.

## Day 1: Fighting Claude Code (The Problem)

Every conversation was Groundhog Day:

- "What's our testing framework again?"
- "How do we name files in this project?"  
- "What's the deployment process?"

I was Claude Code's personal Wikipedia. **This had to change.**

## Day 2: The Teaching Template (The Mentor)

> What if Claude Code could remember your project like a team member who's been there for years?

Instead of explaining everything every time, I wrote a template. The gist is:

```md
# Communication: Be concise, reference past learnings from docs/work/
# File Naming: YYYY-MM-DD-[001]-[category]-[summary].md  
# Never code without checking docs/work/ for similar past solutions
```

That's it. **This eliminated hours of repetitive context.**

<MinimalDetails summary="See the prompt →">

```md
# Project: [Your Project Name]

## Tech Stack & Tooling
- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Package Manager**: `uv` (use `uv add <dependency>`, `uv run <script>`)
- **Testing**: pytest with coverage
- **Linting**: ruff + mypy

## Systematic File Naming
Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-[001-999]-[category]-[four-word-summary].md`
Folder: `docs/work/`
Categories: `bug` | `feature` | `task` | `research` | `learnings`

Examples:
- `2025-07-18-001-feature-user-authentication-system.md`
- `2025-07-18-002-bug-database-connection-timeout.md`

## Communication Style
- **Concise**: No fluff, direct responses
- **Evidence-based**: Show, don't just tell
- **Contextual**: Reference past learnings from `docs/work/`

## Planning Protocol
1. **Context Gathering**: Check `docs/work/` for relevant past decisions
2. **Assumption Documentation**: Explicit assumptions in plan files
3. **Execution Gate**: Only proceed after planning is complete
```

</MinimalDetails>

**The transformation was instant.** Claude Code started referencing past decisions, avoiding repeated mistakes, and building on previous work. **It finally felt like working with a teammate.**

## Day 3: The Learning Moment - 30% context - (The Training)

> What if Claude Code could learn from every mistake and never repeat it?

When your context hits 30%, you have one chance to crystallize everything learned. Miss it, and you go back to day 1.



<MinimalDetails summary="See the prompt →">

```md

When context drops below 30%: 

1. Document every decision made
2. List what failed (with code snippets)  
3. Note what worked brilliantly
4. Write handoff notes for next session

Use the `Systematic File Naming` given above.
```

</MinimalDetails>


## Day 4: The Autonomous Engineer (The Victory)

I saw this tweet - [@svs used Claude Code as an MCP client to write an MCP server](https://x.com/_svs_/status/1928753160337637726). 

Something magical discovered: **When put in verifiable workflows, Claude Code started working much better!**:

- Write code → Run tests → Fix failures → Repeat
- Build feature → Deploy to staging → Check logs → Iterate  
- Analyze data → Generate insights → Verify against sources → Summarize

**I wasn't micromanaging anymore. I was collaborating.**

## Stories from other folks

Met awesome folks at [Fifth Elephant Conference](https://hasgeek.com/fifthelephant/2025/) where we shared claude code learnings.

<TipsSection contributor="Rajesh" contributorUrl="https://www.linkedin.com/in/codingnirvana/">

### The Token Budget Hack That Doubled My Productivity

Rajesh was burning through tokens like crazy at his startup. Then he discovered something weird about Claude's [5-hour windows](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/11145838-using-claude-code-with-your-pro-or-max-plan).

**His discovery:** Start sessions at 7 AM instead of 9 AM.

Why? The overlapping windows create a "double token zone" during peak hours:

**Before:** 9am-2pm, 2pm-7pm (standard)  
**After:** 7am-12pm, 12pm-5pm, 5pm-10pm (overlapping)

**Result:** Between 9am-5pm = **double tokens available**

### The CSV Strategy That Saved Hours

Rajesh's team was dealing with lots of data analysis requests. CSV files everywhere. Claude kept hitting context limits trying to process raw data.

**The breakthrough:** Stop feeding Claude data. Feed it scripts.

**Old way:** "Here's a 10MB CSV, analyze it"  
**New way:** "Write a script to analyze this CSV type, then run it"

**Why it works:** Scripts are tiny. Results are focused. Claude guides itself using its own analysis output.

### The Accidental Discovery That Changed Everything

Ashwant was debugging a frustrating session. In a moment of rage, he accidentally hit ESC four times.

**What happened next blew his mind.**

Claude Code showed him a prompt history he'd never seen before. Every conversation. Every context. **Time travel for developers.**

**The magic combo:** ESC + ESC + ESC + ESC = Prompt history navigation

**Game changer:** You can resurrect any previous session state instantly.

### Claude Code as Your Database Whisperer

At ShelfRadar, Ashwant deployed Claude Code as their internal SQL agent. 

**The setup:** Claude Code + database schema = autonomous query optimizer

**The result:** 

- Ad-hoc queries refined automatically
- Schema changes don't break queries  
- Claude evolves with your database

</TipsSection>

**The question isn't whether Claude Code is teachable.**  
**The question is: Are you ready to become its teacher?**

Update 1: Claude code introduced hooks. Here is a short collection of hooks that I find useful for my workflow.

1. bash script to notify the end of claude code turns. 


<MinimalDetails summary="Full bash script →">
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Read hook input data
INPUT=$(cat)
SESSION_DIR=$(basename "$(pwd)")

# Extract message from transcript if available
TRANSCRIPT_PATH=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.transcript_path')
if [ -f "$TRANSCRIPT_PATH" ]; then
  MSG=$(tail -10 "$TRANSCRIPT_PATH" |
    jq -r 'select(.message.role == "assistant") | .message.content[0].text' |
    tail -1 | tr '\n' ' ' | cut -c1-60)
  MSG=${MSG:-"Task completed"}
else
  MSG="Task completed"
fi

# Show Linux desktop notification (requires notify-send)
notify-send "Claude Code ($SESSION_DIR) Done" "$MSG"
```
